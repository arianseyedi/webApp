# webApp

Welcome to this repo. Here I will share my webApplications. Currently this repo holds the following projects:  
   
   - Search and Rescue: simple search and rescue game. In this game user gets to set the window size for the game and the radar size. Then the rescuer will move on linear trajectories to find the target. The elapsed time and distance to the target are shown as well. Once the borders touch, the search will stop. 
   
   ### Enjoy!
